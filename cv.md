## About Me

I've been worked in IT industry since 2010 as IT Technician/Support Engineer. I have started learn coding and Frontend technologies since 2019 mostly by self education - read books, manuals, watched educational videos. Professional Web Developer - this is the main of my goals for next few years. I study and practise every day to achieve my goals. I consider myself well motivated and purposeful because I know that:
